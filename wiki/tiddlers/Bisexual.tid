title: Bisexual

Bisexual is both a sexual identity and an umbrella term. As a sexual identity, it describes someone who is attracted to multiple genders, specifically two or more. It is commonly referred to as having sexual attraction to both men and women, but bisexual people can be attracted to any gender. Bisexuality as an umbrella term can also include other sexualities like [[pansexual|Pansexual]], [[omnisexual|Omnisexual]], and [[polysexual|Polysexual]] although this list is not exhaustive (neither is really any of this wiki).

The romantic counterpart to bisexuality is [[biromanticism|Biromantic]].
