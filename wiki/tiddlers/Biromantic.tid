title: Biromantic

Biromantic is both a romantic orientation and an umbrella term. As a romantic orientation, it describes someone who is attracted to multiple genders, specifically two or more. It is commonly referred to as having romantic attraction to both men and women, but biromantic people can be attracted to any gender. Biromanticism as an umbrella term can also include other romantic orientations like [[panromanticism|Panromantic]], [[omniromanticism|Omniromantic]], and [[polyromanticism|Polyromantic]] although this list is not exhaustive (neither is really any of this wiki).

The sexual counterpart to biromanticism is [[bisexuality|Bisexual]].
